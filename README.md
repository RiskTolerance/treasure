Aye, landlubber, heed my lore,
Of pirates bold and factory floor.
In the clatter of gears and the ship’s full sail,
Both seek a treasure, yet sometimes fail.

In the factory’s hum or the ocean’s sway,
Something slows us on our way.
Pirates or workers, alike we fret,
When progress halts, what do we get?

Machines may grind and ships may stall,
One problem’s the bane of them all.
A chokepoint feared, like a pirate’s snare,
What be the trouble lurking there?

Answer quick, time does tick,
The cursed, dreaded... "_____________"
